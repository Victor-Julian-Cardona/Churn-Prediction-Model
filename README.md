# Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, the model identifies patterns and factors leading to churn. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development using logistic regression. The final model is integrated into a Django-based web application, providing actionable insights through a CRM tool to help the company retain at-risk customers.
